    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I was born on August, 4th 2006 in Toledo. I lived in Metamora and 
            went to <em>Evergreen Elementary School</em> until 5th grade. I 
            moved to <em>Delta</em> in 6th grade and have lived there since. 
            I'm the second child of my parents who have four kids. We have a 
            pet dog named Kahmari. I like to keep my room organized in a 
            way were I know were everything is but it might look messy to 
            everyone else. I have a PS5, a Nintendo switch, a TV, and a laptop. 
            I used to also be in band at Delta before I came to Four County.

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            My hobbies include collecting pokémon cards, Playing both video 
            and board games, collecting rocks and sorting my pokémon cards 
            when i'm bored. I have easily over 700 different pokémon cards and 
            over 1000 total pokémon cards. If one day I decide to sell all my 
            pokemon cards I could get well over $400 dollars. I also like to play 
            video Games like <span class="gameNames">The Legend of Zelda, 
            Final Fantasy, Pokémon, Empires of the Undergrowth, and Minecraft
            </span>. My favorite Board games are <span class="gameNames">Battleship,
            Clue, Chess, Backgammon, and Uno. </span>
