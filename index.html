    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
        I was born on August, 4th 2006 in Toledo. I lived in Metamora and 
        went to <em>Evergreen Elementary School</em> until 5th grade. I 
        moved to <em>Delta</em> in 6th grade and have lived there since. 
        I'm the second child of my parents who have four kids. We have a 
        pet dog named Kahmari. I like to keep my room organized in a 
        way were I know were everything is but it might look messy to 
        everyone else. I have a PS5, a Nintendo switch, a TV, and a laptop. 
        I used to also be in band at Delta before I came to Four County.
