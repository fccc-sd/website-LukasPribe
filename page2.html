    <h3>Game Systems</h3>
    <p>
        I have a lot of game systems but not all of them are used anymore. 
        I have a Play Station 3, a Play Station 4, and a Play Station 5, 
        I also have a Wii, a Nintendo Switch, and a Nintendo 3DS. I used 
        to have a Nintendo DS but it broke when it got hit by a ball. We 
        also had a Super Nintendo Entertainment System and a Nintendo 
        64 but my brother has those now. The system that had the best games 
        would probably be the Play Station 3 and the Nintendo 64 since those 
        had my first Final Fantasy and The Legend of Zelda games.
